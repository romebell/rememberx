## Background & Overview

Remembrrr is a demo spaced repetition website that provides a user with a plateform to where they can create notes in the form of flashcards and be reminded to review those at a later time to avoid forgetting the material. With Remembrrr you will be able to never forget anything you want to remember.

The spaced repeition algorithm, founded by Dr Piotr Wozniak, will remind on a day right before your brain will forget the material to review it again.
